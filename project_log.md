# JV Web App - Project Log

## 📅 2025-06-29

## 📅 2025-06-29 (Session 2)

### ✅ Section 3 Financial Dashboard Enhanced
- Transformed equity display into comprehensive financial dashboard
- Added dynamic ruler/scale showing contribution amounts
- Implemented profit distribution calculations:
  - Monthly dividends (quarterly P&L ÷ 3)
  - Quarterly profits (from actual P&L data)
  - Annual projections (quarterly × 4)
- Added ROI and Payback Period calculations
- Fixed HTML structure issues (Notes/Export showing on all pages)

### ✅ P&L Integration with jvStore
- Extended jvStore to include P&L data (netProfit, unitsSold, margins)
- P&L Statement now saves quarterly profit data to jvStore
- Section 3 reads real P&L data for accurate dividend calculations
- ROI calculated as: (Annual Profit / Total Investment) × 100
- Payback Period: Total Investment / Annual Profit

### 📊 Complete Data Flow Established
1. Working Capital Simulator → calculates BC investment
2. P&L Statement → calculates quarterly profits
3. Section 3 Dashboard → combines all data:
   - Real equity split based on contributions
   - Actual profit distributions based on P&L
   - Dynamic ROI and payback calculations

### 🎨 UI Improvements
- Professional gradient bars for equity visualization
- Symmetric layout with Partner A (left) vs Partner BC (right)
- Dynamic ruler scale adjusting to contribution amounts
- Color-coded financial metrics

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- Fixed jvStore structure (removed nested pnlData)
- Fixed programmatic input updates not triggering events
- Corrected HTML structure for Section 3 containment

➡️ Next: Fix Section 2 display issues (standalone vs integrated)

---

### ✅ jvStore.js Implemented & Integrated
- Created centralized state management system (jvStore.js)
- Simple get/set methods with dot notation support for nested values
- Event-based subscription system for reactive updates
- Successfully integrated with Working Capital Simulator (Section 2)

### ✅ Section 3 Refactored for A vs BC Structure
- Simplified contribution model to reflect actual partnership (A vs BC)
- Removed internal B:C split from equity calculations
- Set sensible defaults:
  - Partner A CapEx: ₹2 Cr
  - Partner BC Market/Ops Value: ₹50 L
  - Partner BC Renovation: ₹50 L
- Working Capital flows automatically from simulator

### ✅ Horizontal Equity Bar Visualization
- Created intuitive horizontal stacked bar showing A vs BC equity split
- Real-time updates as contributions change
- Shows both percentages and absolute contribution values
- Clean, professional design with color coding

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Fixed programmatic input updates not triggering events
- Established clear data flow: Simulator → jvStore → UI Updates
- All sections now reactive to data changes

### 📊 Current Data Flow
1. Working Capital Simulator calculates BC investment need
2. Data saved to jvStore automatically
3. Section 3 reads from jvStore and updates UI
4. Equity percentages recalculate in real-time
5. Visual bar chart updates instantly

➡️ Next: Connect remaining sections to jvStore (Governance, Profit Policy, etc.)

### ✅ Project Context Document Created
- Comprehensive context document created for cross-workspace development
- Includes architecture decisions, implementation status, and technical patterns
- Added detailed business rules section from partnership model.docx
- Established workspace startup kit:
  1. Project Context Document
  2. project_log.md (this file)
  3. partnership model.docx
  4. Git repository

### 🔍 Code Review & Architecture Analysis
- Reviewed entire codebase and identified key integration points
- Working Capital Simulator is feature-complete but isolated
- Proposed centralized state management (jvStore.js) to connect all sections
- Identified data flow: Simulator → Contributions → Equity → MoU

➡️ Next: Implement jvStore.js and integrate with existing calculator

## 📅 2025-06-28

### ✅ Section 3 Styling Added
- Contribution table styled for readability and spacing
- Range slider (B:C split) and % indicators styled
- Placeholder chart container styled
- Structure now ready for data-binding and logic wiring

## 📅 2025-06-28

### ✅ Section 1 Styling Complete
- Styled card layouts for overview, profiles, and timeline
- Responsive grid for Partner A/B/C inputs
- Custom CTA button added for "Start Discussion"
- All styles scoped modularly using semantic classes


## 📅 2025-06-28

### ✅ Section 1 Refactored (Based on Updated Spec)
- Replaced form with UI components from planning doc:
  - JV Overview Textarea
  - Partner Profile Cards (Name, Role, Avatar)
  - Timeline Card with milestones
  - "Start Discussion" button
- Prepares base for interactive editing and launch triggers


## 📅 2025-06-28

### ✅ UI Theme Finalized
- Global color scheme and typography set using CSS variables
- Google Fonts `Inter` (body) and `Poppins` (headings) integrated
- Theme stored in `:root` for easy future updates

➡️ Next: Build Section 1 form layout – JV name, partners, and setup metadata


## 📅 2025-06-28

### ✅ Base UI Framework Created
- `main.css` built with retractable sidebar, active tab highlighting, section placeholders
- `main.js` manages sidebar toggle, section navigation, and submenu handling
- Vertical navigation bar replaces flat tabs for better UX

➡️ Next: Add Section 1 content UI – Overview & Setup Form (JV Name, Partners, Start Date, etc.)


## 📅 2025-06-28

### ✅ HTML Skeleton Created
- Full `index.html` layout built with 11 modular sections
- Dynamic component loader set up for Working Capital Simulator
- Integrated calculator module from `/modules/calculator` with HTML/CSS/JS injection
- Section 2 now fully functional with existing simulator logic


## ✅ Current Status (as of 2025-06-27)
- Planning Document Finalized (Canvas: "JV Web Interface Layout")
- Development workflow established using ChatGPT + Git + VS Code
- Web interface will be operated live by Partner C during JV meetings
- Phase 1 build approach defined:
  - Page Skeleton → Section Selection → Placeholder UI → Component Development
- ProjectLog.md created to track each modular milestone

---

## 📅 2025-06-27

### ✅ Planning Complete
- All 11 interface sections finalized with layout, purpose, and components
- Working Capital Simulator repositioned as Section 2 (due to dependency on operational inputs)
- Contribution Builder made dynamic, syncing directly with simulator output
- Workflow for development (ChatGPT-driven, Git-tracked) established and approved

### ✅ Setup Strategy Finalized
- Will use Canvas for code tracking and modular edits
- Local repo in VS Code using Git for changes and backup
- I (Partner C) will operate the interface during partner meetings and lead finalization of MoU

### 🧠 Design Notes
- Simulator output influences capital contribution and equity logic (real-data-driven)
- MoU Builder will generate legal document dynamically from agreed section inputs
- Modular layout enables partner-specific negotiations before joint finalization

### 🔄 Next Step
- Generate complete HTML5 skeleton layout with section containers and IDs
- Link style and script files for modular expansion

---

## 📝 Dev Notes
- ProjectLog.md will be updated **after each significant development step** or partner review
- Use short, clear notes with date headers to track changes across Git and ChatGPT sessions
- This file acts as external memory and development anchor when switching workspaces

## 📅 2025-06-28

### ✔ Bug Fix
- Handled divide-by-zero in ruler scale function to prevent NaN positions when contributions total is zero
